## 1.4 Modularization - Basics and Overview

### Overview
In this lesson you will learn why it makes sense to store parts of programs in modularization units. You will also gain an overview of the various modularization options in ABAP programs.

### Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Name the basic modularization techniques

### Important topics

#### Modularization Technique
There are two techniques for **local program modularization** in the ABAP programming language:
- **Subroutines**, also known as form routines
- **Methods** in local classes
*Hint*: For historical reasons it is technically possible to call a subroutine from another program too. You should not use this option, however, since this technique contradicts the principle of encapsulation of data
and functions.

There are also two techniques for **global modularization** in the ABAP programming language:
- **Function modules** that are organized in function groups
- **Methods in global classes**
  
*Hint*: Globally defined modularization units can be used by any number of programs at the same time. The globally defined modularization units are stored centrally in the Repository and loaded when required (in other words, when called) into the context of the calling program.

#### Encapsulating Data

Ideally, the modularization units that are called do not use the data objects of the calling program directly. This applies the other way round too: Data in the modularization units should not be changed directly by the calling program. This principle is known as data encapsulation.

Data encapsulation is an important aid in developing transparent, maintainable source code. It makes it far easier to comprehend whereabouts in the program the contents of data objects were changed. In addition, it is easier to ensure that data within the modularization units is changed consistently if, for example, the contents of several data objects within a modularization unit are mutually dependent.
