## 1.8 Working with structures

### Overview
In this lesson, we will continue with the definition of structured data objects (structure variables) and their analysis using the ABAP Debugger. You will also learn how to use basic ABAP statements for structured data objects.

### Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define structured data objects (structure variables)
- Use basic ABAP statements for structured data objects
- Analyze structured data objects in debugging mode

Structure variables are defined in the program in the same way as elementary data objects with the DATA statement. When you set the types, you can refer to:
