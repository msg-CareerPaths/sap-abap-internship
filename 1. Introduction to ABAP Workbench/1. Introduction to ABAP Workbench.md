## Introduction to the ABAP Workbench

### Overview
This lesson contains a short description of the Repository and a brief overview of the most important components of the ABAP Workbench. It presents the Object Navigator as a central development tool.
You learn how to create new Repository objects, special packages, programs and transaction codes. You also learn how change requests in the ABAP Workbench are used in the SAP environment to organize development projects and ensure consistent transport of changes to the productive systems.

### Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Describe the structure of the Repository
- Name and use the search tools of the Repository
- Use the Object Navigator for displaying Repository objects
- Create packages, programs, transactions

### Important topics

#### Structure of the Repository

#### Random search for Repository Objects using Repository Information System

#### Workbench Tools
The ABAP Workbench includes all tools required for creating and editing Repository objects. These tools cover the entire software development cycle. The most important tools are:
  - The *ABAP Editor* for editing source code
  - The *ABAP Dictionary* for editing database table definitions, central data types, and so on
  - The *Screen Painter* for configuring screens (screens together with functions for user dialogs)
  - The *Menu Painter* for designing user interfaces (menu bar, standard toolbar, application toolbar, function key settings)
  - The *Function Builder* for maintaining function modules
  - The *Class Builder* for maintaining global classes and interfaces

#### Transporting Development Objects
  - Customizing and changed or newly created objects are transferred to other systems in the landscape through transports.
  - Various changes are grouped into multiple tasks, each of which is assigned to one user.

#### ABAP Programming Language

- *ABAP* is a programing language developed by SAP for programming business applications within the SAP environment. The ABAP programming language:
  - is strongly typed
  - supports internationalization
  - provides integrated database access through Open SQL
  - supports both procedural and object-oriented programming
  - is platform-independent
  - Exposes functionality to external systems through Remote Function Calls (RFC)
- *General rules*:
  - ABAP programs consist of individual statements
  - Each statement ends with a period “.”
  - Words must always be separated by at least one space.
  - For indentations and for converting uppercase/lowercase letters, you can use the Pretty Printer

#### The ABAP Editor

#### Activating Programs

## Basic ABAP Language Elements

### Overview
In this lesson you will become familiar with the difference between data types and data objects (first only the elementary ones) and you will learn how to define and use these in a program. You will also learn some basic ABAP statements. Furthermore, you will find out how to use the ABAP Debugger for analyzing a program flow.

### Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define elementary data objects (simple variables)
- Use basic ABAP statements with elementary data objects
- Execute and analyze programs in debugging mode

### Important topics

#### Data Types and Data Objects
A formal variable description is called a **data type**. By contrast, a variable or constant that is defined concretely by means of a data type is called a **data object**.

#### Using Data Types
*Defining Data Objects*
The type of a data object defines its technical (and possibly also semantic)properties.
*Definition of interface parameters*
The type of an interface parameter determines the type of the actual parameter that is transferred when the modularization unit is called.
*Definition of input/output fields*
The type of an input/output field can provide further information in addition to the technical characteristics, such as the field and value input help.

#### ABAP Standard Types
- *Complete ABAP Standard Types* already contain a type-specific, fixed length specification.

- *Incomplete ABAP Standard Types* do not contain a fixed length (incomplete). When they are used to define data objects, you therefore still need to specify the length of the variable.
  - **C**
    Type for character string (**C**haracter) for which the fixed length is to be specified
    
  - **N**
    Type for numerical character string (**N**umerical character) for which the fixed length is to be specified
    
  - **X**
    Type for byte sequence (He**X**adecimal string) for which the fixed lengthis to be specified
  - **P**
    Type for packed number (**P**acked number) for which the fixed length is to be specified. (In the definition of a packed number, the number of decimal points may also be specified.)

#### Local Data Types
Using standard types, you can declare *local data types* in the program that can then be more complete or complex than the underlying standard types. Local data types only exist in the program in question and hence can only be used there. The declaration is made using the `TYPES` statement.

#### Global Data Types
A data type defined in the ABAP Dictionary is called *global* as it can be used throughout the entire system (that means in the entire SAP system in question)
