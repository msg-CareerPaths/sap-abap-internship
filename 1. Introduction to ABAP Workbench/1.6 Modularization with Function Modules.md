## 1.6 Modularization with Function Modules

### Overview
In this lesson you will learn how to search for function modules, analyze their interfaces and documentation, and test their functions. You will learn how to use existing function modules in your programs and what you have to do to catch and handle errors. Finally, you will create function modules yourself and encapsulate functions in them that you can then reuse in other programs.

### Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Search for function modules
- Acquire information on the functionality and use of function modules
- Call function modules in your program
- Create a function group
- Create a function module
