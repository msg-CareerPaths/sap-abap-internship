## 1.12 Selection screen

### Overview

In this unit, ABAP commands for generating a selection screen, as well as other additions and techniques are presented. ABAP events that belong to the selection screen (such as AT SELECTION-SCREEN), are discussed. The creation of variants is dealt with as well as the dynamic changing of selection screens.

### Objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:
- Explain the purpose of selection screens
- Create input fields with PARAMETERS
- Create input fields with SELECT-OPTIONS
- Design the selection screen
- Define additional selection screens
- Define subscreens
- Define a tabstrip within a selection screen
- Implement input checks for selection screens
- Create variants for a selection screen

### Important topics

#### Creating Fields in the Selection Screen

You can maintain selection texts using the menu path *Goto → Text Elements → Selection Texts*.

#### Selections with SELECT-OPTIONS

Additions to the SELECT-OPTIONS statement are:

- DEFAULT enables you to set default values for the parameters low or low and high. You can use OPTION and SIGN to set default values for option and sign that differ from the default values.
- If you assign a MEMORY ID <pid>, the system retrieves the current value from the SAP memory, automatically outputs it to the screen, and writes it back again when you exit the screen (including any changes you might
have made).
- LOWER CASE suppresses conversion of the entry into uppercase, provided that the domain allows this or typing was carried on ABAP type C.
- OBLIGATORY generates a required entry field. A checkmark appears in the entry field in the selection screen, and the user must enter a value.
- NO-EXTENSION suppresses the multiple selection option.
- NO INTERVALS suppresses the upper interval limit (<seltab>-high) on the selection screen. You can use the additional screen Multiple selection to enter intervals.
