**Authorization Objects and Authorizations (Example)**

**Authorization objects** can be defined within object classes. When you define an authorization object, you have to specify appropriate fields (without values). You create an actual authorization by subsequently assigning values to these fields. This authorization can be integrated into the required user master records by means of an **authorization profile**.

At runtime, you can use the AUTHORITY-CHECK statement to check whether the current user has the authorization required for executing the function in his or her user master record. Depending on the check result (sy-subrc), you can continue your program accordingly:

- sy-subrc = 0: User has required authorization -> display data, for example
- sy-subrc <> 0: Authorization not available -> display error message to user, for example.
