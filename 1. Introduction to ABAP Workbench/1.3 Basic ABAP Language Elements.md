## 1.3 Basic ABAP Language Elements

### Overview
In this lesson you will become familiar with the difference between data types and data objects (first only the elementary ones) and you will learn how to define and use these in a program. You will also learn some basic ABAP statements. Furthermore, you will find out how to use the ABAP Debugger for analyzing a program flow.

### Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define elementary data objects (simple variables)
- Use basic ABAP statements with elementary data objects
- Execute and analyze programs in debugging mode

### Important topics

#### Data Types and Data Objects
A formal variable description is called a **data type**. By contrast, a variable or constant that is defined concretely by means of a data type is called a **data object**.

#### Using Data Types
*Defining Data Objects*
The type of a data object defines its technical (and possibly also semantic)properties.
*Definition of interface parameters*
The type of an interface parameter determines the type of the actual parameter that is transferred when the modularization unit is called.
*Definition of input/output fields*
The type of an input/output field can provide further information in addition to the technical characteristics, such as the field and value input help.

#### ABAP Standard Types
- *Complete ABAP Standard Types* already contain a type-specific, fixed length specification.

- *Incomplete ABAP Standard Types* do not contain a fixed length (incomplete). When they are used to define data objects, you therefore still need to specify the length of the variable.
  - **C**
    Type for character string (**C**haracter) for which the fixed length is to be specified
    
  - **N**
    Type for numerical character string (**N**umerical character) for which the fixed length is to be specified
    
  - **X**
    Type for byte sequence (He**X**adecimal string) for which the fixed lengthis to be specified
  - **P**
    Type for packed number (**P**acked number) for which the fixed length is to be specified. (In the definition of a packed number, the number of decimal points may also be specified.)

#### Local Data Types
Using standard types, you can declare *local data types* in the program that can then be more complete or complex than the underlying standard types. Local data types only exist in the program in question and hence can only be used there. The declaration is made using the `TYPES` statement.

#### Global Data Types
A data type defined in the ABAP Dictionary is called *global* as it can be used throughout the entire system (that means in the entire SAP system in question)
