## 1.5 Modularization with Subroutines

### Overview
In this lesson you will learn how to employ subroutines in ABAP programs. Furthermore, you will learn how the interface of a subroutine is used to pass parameters and how the different transfer types are used.

### Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define subroutines
- Call subroutines
- Analyze the execution of subroutines in debugging mode

### Important topics

A subroutine is a modularization unit within a program. For the ABAP interpreter, it is always part of the main program. No parameters are used in the above example, which makes the subroutine call very simple to structure.
If variables were defined in the main program, these are visible globally within the program and can be changed at any point on the entire program. This means that subroutines that are defined within the main program can change them too.

The way these main program variables are passed to the formal parameters of the subroutine is called the pass type and is specified for each parameter in the interface of the subroutine.
There are three pass types for subroutines:
- call by value
- call by value and result
- call by reference
