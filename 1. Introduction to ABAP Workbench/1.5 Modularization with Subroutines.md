## 1.5 Modularization with Subroutines

### Overview
In this lesson you will learn how to employ subroutines in ABAP programs. Furthermore, you will learn how the interface of a subroutine is used to pass parameters and how the different transfer types are used.

### Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define subroutines
- Call subroutines
- Analyze the execution of subroutines in debugging mode

### Important topics

A subroutine is a modularization unit within a program. For the ABAP interpreter, it is always part of the main program. No parameters are used in the above example, which makes the subroutine call very simple to structure.
If variables were defined in the main program, these are visible globally within the program and can be changed at any point on the entire program. This means that subroutines that are defined within the main program can change them too.

**Structure of a subroutine**
- A subroutine is introduced with FORM.
- You specify the name and the interface of the subroutine after FORM.
- The statements of the subroutine then follow.
- The ENDFORM statement concludes the subroutine.

In the interface definition you list the formal parameters of the subroutine (here: f1, f2, f3) and type them if necessary. The required pass type has to be specified for each parameter:
*call by value*
You list each of the formal parameters that should have the pass type “Call by Value” (here: f1) with the VALUE prefix under USING.(Refer to the above graphic for the syntax.)
*call by value and result*
You list each of the formal parameters that should have the pass type “Call by Value and Result” (here: f2) with the VALUE prefix under CHANGING. (Refer to the above graphic for the syntax.)
*call by reference*
You list each of the formal parameters that should have the pass type “Call by Reference” (here: f3) without the VALUE prefix under CHANGING. (Refer to the above graphic for the syntax.)

*Hint*: A parameter without the VALUE prefix, but placed in the USING section also has the pass type “Call by Reference”. However, this declaration syntax only makes sense for formal parameters that are passed to larger internal tables, which are not to be changed in the subroutine (documentation via USING) but are to be passed using “Call by Reference” in order to avoid making time-consuming copies.
When the subroutine is called, the actual parameters to be transferred without the VALUE-prefix are specified under USING or CHANGING. The order of specification determines their assignment to the formal parameters. In the example in the above graphic, a is passed to f1, b to f2, and c to f3.

#### Local and Global Data Objects

Variables defined in the main program are *global* data objects. They are visible (can be addressed) in the entire main program as well as in every subroutine called.
Variables defined within a subroutine are called *local* since they only exist in the relevant subroutine - just like formal parameters. Memory space for formal parameters and local data objects is only allocated when the subroutine is called and is released again after execution.
The formal parameters and local data objects of a subroutine cannot have the same names.
