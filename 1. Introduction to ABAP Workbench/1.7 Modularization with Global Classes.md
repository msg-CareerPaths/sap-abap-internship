## 1.7 Modularization with Global Classes

### Overview

In this lesson you will be introduced to another technique for cross-program modularization: The call of methods of global classes. In a similar way to the function groups and function modules, we will first look for, analyze, test, and use existing classes and methods. In an additional step we will then create a global class with a simple method. Note that this lesson is not intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to
object-oriented programming with ABAP. You should merely familiarize yourself with the basic terms of object-oriented programming so that you can use the functions of existing global classes in your own programs.

### Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain the basic terms of object-oriented programming
- Acquire information about the function and use of global classes and their methods
- Call methods of global classes in your programs
- Create global classes
- Create and implement simple methods in global classes
