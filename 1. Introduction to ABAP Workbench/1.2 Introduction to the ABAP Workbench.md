#### Workbench Tools
The ABAP Workbench includes all tools required for creating and editing Repository objects. These tools cover the entire software development cycle. The most important tools are:
  - The *ABAP Editor* for editing source code
  - The *ABAP Dictionary* for editing database table definitions, central data types, and so on
  - The *Screen Painter* for configuring screens (screens together with functions for user dialogs)
  - The *Menu Painter* for designing user interfaces (menu bar, standard toolbar, application toolbar, function key settings)
  - The *Function Builder* for maintaining function modules
  - The *Class Builder* for maintaining global classes and interfaces

#### Transporting Development Objects
  - Customizing and changed or newly created objects are transferred to other systems in the landscape through transports.
  - Various changes are grouped into multiple tasks, each of which is assigned to one user.

#### ABAP Programming Language

- *ABAP* is a programing language developed by SAP for programming business applications within the SAP environment. The ABAP programming language:
  - is strongly typed
  - supports internationalization
  - provides integrated database access through Open SQL
  - supports both procedural and object-oriented programming
  - is platform-independent
  - Exposes functionality to external systems through Remote Function Calls (RFC)
- *General rules*:
  - ABAP programs consist of individual statements
  - Each statement ends with a period “.”
  - Words must always be separated by at least one space.
  - For indentations and for converting uppercase/lowercase letters, you can use the Pretty Printer
