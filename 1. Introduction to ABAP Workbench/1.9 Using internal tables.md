## 1.9 Using internal tables

### Overview
In this lesson, you will learn how to define internal tables and use them in ABAP programs. Following this, you will analyze the internal tables in the ABAP Debugger at runtime.

### Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Define internal tables
- Use basic ABAP statements with internal tables
- Analyze internal tables in debugging mode

### Important topics

An internal table is a data object, in which you can keep several identically structured data records at runtime (table variable). The number of data records is restricted only by the capacity of specific system installations.

The row type of an internal table can be specified through any data type and describes the row structure of the table entries.

Internal tables are therefore a simple way of processing large data sets in a structured manner. Typical uses include:

- Retaining data from database tables or sequential files for future processing
- Formatting data for screen or printer output (e.g., sort)
- Format data for using other services (for example, for method, function module or subroutine calls)

**Attributes of Internal Tables**

The following properties specify an internal table completely:

- *Line type*
- *Key*
- *Table kind*

Depending on the access type, you should always choose the most suitable of the following three table kinds in order to enable high performance accesses:

- With standard tables, the row numbering (index) is maintained internally. Both index and key accesses are possible.
You should choose this table kind if you mostly use the index to access the internal table.
- With sorted tables, the data records are automatically sorted in ascending order of the keys. Here, too, the index is maintained internally. Both index and key accesses are possible.
You should choose this table kind if you normally access the internal table with the key or would like the table to be automatically sorted by key.
- With hashed tables, the data records are managed for fast key access using the hashing procedure. A unique key is required here. With hashed tables, only key accesses are possible.
You should choose this table kind if the internal table is very large and you want to access it by key only.

The type of an internal table is called **table type**. Table types can be defined globally in the ABAP Dictionary or locally in a program.

You can use the following statements for deleting the table contents:

**REFRESH**
This deletes the entire contents of the internal table. A part of the previously used memory remains available for future insertions.

**CLEAR**
With internal tables without a header line (all those that have been previously defined in the course), the CLEAR statement has the same effect as REFRESH. For internal tables with a header line (see below) in contrast, it initializes only the header line.

**FREE**
This deletes the entire contents of the internal table and releases the previously used memory. You use the FREE statement for internal tables that have already been evaluated and are no longer required in the further course of the program. This has the effect that previously assigned but no longer required memory becomes available again.
