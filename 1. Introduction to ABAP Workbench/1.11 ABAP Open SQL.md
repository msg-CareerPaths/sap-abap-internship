## 1.11 ABAP Open SQL

### Overview

In this unit, we will take a closer look on the WHERE and INTO clause of the ABAP Open SQL statement. In addition, reading data from multiple database tables is discussed.

### Objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

- Explain the importance of the possible operators in WHERE conditions
- Use the different operators correctly
- Know the options available for specifying data objects after INTO
- Implement sequential processing of large data volumes
- Request aggregated data from the database
- Use aggregate functions correctly
- Use views and formulate joins correctly
- Understand and use subqueries
- Use the FOR ALL ENTRIES addition correctly

### Important topics

**Operators in WHERE Conditions**

| Operator | Meaning and use |
| :------------ | :------------ |
| =, <, >, <=, <=, <> (EQ, LT, GT, LE, GE, NE) | Comparison with a single value. In character-type fields, the result of size comparisons may depend on the database code page. |
| IN (dobj1, dobj2, ...) | Comparison with a list of single values. |
| BETWEEN dobj1 AND dobj2 | Comparison with an interval. In character-type fields, the result may depend on the database code page. |
| LIKE dobj | Comparison with character strings. The _ and % placeholders let you define a comparison pattern in dobj.
| IN seltab | Evaluation of a selection table (select-options) |
| IS [NOT] NULL | Checks whether the database field has a null value. |
| AND, OR | Link of logical expressions. |
| NOT | Negation of a logical expression. |
