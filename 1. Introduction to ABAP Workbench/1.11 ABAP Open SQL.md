## 1.11 ABAP Open SQL

### Overview

In this unit, we will take a closer look on the WHERE and INTO clause of the ABAP Open SQL statement. In addition, reading data from multiple database tables is discussed.

### Objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

- Explain the importance of the possible operators in WHERE conditions
- Use the different operators correctly
- Know the options available for specifying data objects after INTO
- Implement sequential processing of large data volumes
- Request aggregated data from the database
- Use aggregate functions correctly
- Use views and formulate joins correctly
- Understand and use subqueries
- Use the FOR ALL ENTRIES addition correctly

### Important topics

#### Operators in WHERE Conditions

| Operator | Meaning and use |
| :------------ | :------------ |
| =, <, >, <=, <=, <> (EQ, LT, GT, LE, GE, NE) | Comparison with a single value. In character-type fields, the result of size comparisons may depend on the database code page. |
| IN (dobj1, dobj2, ...) | Comparison with a list of single values. |
| BETWEEN dobj1 AND dobj2 | Comparison with an interval. In character-type fields, the result may depend on the database code page. |
| LIKE dobj | Comparison with character strings. The _ and % placeholders let you define a comparison pattern in dobj.
| IN seltab | Evaluation of a selection table (select-options) |
| IS [NOT] NULL | Checks whether the database field has a null value. |
| AND, OR | Link of logical expressions. |
| NOT | Negation of a logical expression. |

#### Agregated Expressions

| Function | Meaning of Result and Conditions | Data Type of Result |
| :------------ | :------------ | :------------ | 
| MIN( col ) | Minimum value in the col column within the result set | Like the col column |
| MAX( col ) | Maximum value in the col column within the result set | Like the col column |
| SUM( col ) | Sum of the contents of the col column in the result set - The col column must be numeric | Like the col column |
| AVG( col ) | Average value of the contents of the col column in the result set - The col column must be numeric | Float (F) |
| COUNT( * ) COUNT(*) | Number of lines in the result set | Integer (I) |

If the field list of a SELECT contains field labels in addition to aggregate expressions, the result is always **multiline**. As a result, you have to load it into an internal table (array fetch) or process it sequentially (SELECT loop). The SELECT statement must contain the **GROUP BY addition** and all fields that are not arguments of an aggregate function in the field list must be listed after the GROUP BY addition.
When you use GROUP BY, you can specify a logical expression after the **HAVING** expression to restrict the result set further.

#### Requesting Sorted Data from the Database
