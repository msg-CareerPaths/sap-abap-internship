## 1.10 Working with database tables

### Overview
In this lesson you learn how database tables are defined and described in the ABAP Dictionary and how to retrieve information on database tables and how to read data from them. An overview of techniques that allow you to access multiple database tables will also be covered.

### Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain the purpose and the benefits of using a data model in application development
- Describe the meaning and the structure of a transparent table
- List different methods for searching relevant database tables
- Program read access to specific columns and rows within a particular database table
- List different methods for read accesses to several database tables

### Important topics

**Technical Structure of a Transparent Table**

In the ABAP Dictionary, a transparent table is an implemented description of the corresponding database table that contains the actual application data. The fields of the transparent table form the identically-named columns of the corresponding database table.

**SQL** is the abbreviation of Structured Query Language, a language that enables define, change, and read access to database tables.

Every relational database system has a **native SQL**, which is unfortunately database-specific. Hence, an ABAP program with native SQL statements cannot be used without restrictions in all SAP systems (due to the different database systems of different SAP systems).

In contrast **Open SQL** is an SAP-defined, database-independent SQL standard for the ABAP language. The Open SQL statements are dynamically converted to the corresponding native SQL statements of the currently used database system and are thus independent of the database. They allow the ABAP programmer uniform access to data, regardless of the database system installed.

There are four types of reuse components that encapsulate database accesses:

- Logical databases
(= data retrieval programs that read data from tables that belong together hierarchically)
- Function Modules
(= subroutines stored in the function library of the SAP system with encapsulated functions, such as reading from hierarchically related tables)
- BAPIs
(= Methods of Business Objects with read function, for example)
- Methods of global classes

**Entries for Defining a Table Join**
