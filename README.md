## Learning path for .msg's SAP Summer School program

The road-map consists of several steps. In each step, a set of theoretical concepts are explored for learning the basics of SAP technologies, supported by reference documentation, book chapters, tutorials and videos. 

In the last 3 weeks of the program, an application will be built with the learned concepts and the guidance of experienced developers.

## Development Environments

The development environments used are:
- SAP NetWeaver Application Server - which provides a complete development infrastructure on which you can develop, distribute, and execute platform-independent, robust, and scalable Web services and business applications.  
  * J2EE: Support for Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE) for developing Java-based business applications
  * ABAP: ABAP is a programming language developed by SAP to develop business applications.
  * DB and OS Abstraction: The SAP NetWeaver Application Server supports a variety of databases and operating systems
- Eclipse with ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse (ADT) - which enables the performing of development tasks using the ABAP application server capabilities in an Eclipse-based IDE or on the classic ABAP Workbench and supports the Core Date Services (CDS) layer for creating and defining data models including code push-downs
