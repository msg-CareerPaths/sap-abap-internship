# Learning path for .msg's SAP Summer School program

The road-map consists of several steps. In each step, a set of theoretical concepts are explored for learning the basics of SAP technologies, supported by reference documentation, book chapters, tutorials and videos. 
In the last 3 weeks of the program, an application will be built with the learned concepts and the guidance of experienced developers.
The development and deployment platform that will be used is SAP NetWeaver. This platform supports web services, business applications and standard based development based on key technologies such as J2EE and ABAP.

Later on, the CDS functionality will be available in Eclipse 
After the introduction of CDS in SAP HANA, SAP realised CDS can be introduced with ABAP application server which will allow ABAP to benefit from the enhanced capabilities that are offered by the data definition language of CDS compared to the form based ABAP Dictionary tool. So, SAP introduced ABAP CDS views in ABAP 7.40 SP05 release. Since the ABAP Dictionary already had the capabilty of defining tables, views and data types, the natural way of introducing CDS on the ABAP application server was to add it to the ABAP Dictionary. 

The first instalment of CDS support in ABAP has been delivered with SAP NW ABAP 7.4 SP5. Because the CDS functionality is only available for ABAP in Eclipse you need the ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse (ADT) in order to create an ABAP CDS view.
