# Introduction to CDS

To take advantage of SAP HANA for application development, SAP introduced a new data modeling infrastructure known as Core data services. With CDS, data models are defined and consumed on database server rather than on application server. CDS also offers capabilities beyond the traditional data modeling tools, including support for conceptual modeling and relationship definitions, built-in functions, and extensions. 

After the introduction of CDS in SAP HANA, SAP realised CDS can be introduced with ABAP application server which will allow ABAP to benefit from the enhanced capabilities that are offered by the data definition language of CDS compared to the form based ABAP Dictionary tool. So, SAP introduced ABAP CDS views in ABAP 7.40 SP05 release. Since the ABAP Dictionary already had the capabilty of defining tables, views and data types, the natural way of introducing CDS on the ABAP application server was to add it to the ABAP Dictionary. 

The first instalment of CDS support in ABAP has been delivered with SAP NW ABAP 7.4 SP5. Because the CDS functionality is only available for ABAP in Eclipse you need the ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse (ADT) in order to create an ABAP CDS view.

## Concepts

- Data Definition Language (DDL)

  Can bee seen as a SQL enhancement which allows you to define syntactically rich 	database tables and views, which are frequently referred to as CDS-entities.

- Query Language (QL)

	Views defined using CDS DDL can be used either in ABAP programms which use 	Open SQL or in other CDS Views

- Data Control Language (DCL)

	Defines authorizations for CDS-Views

## Syntax & Features

CDS allows the following:
- Strings  and arithmetical expressions
- Literals
- Operators +,-,*,/,unary
- Built-in functions CONCAT, CEIL, MOD,REPLACE,SUBSTRING
- CAST expression
- Length determined at activation
- CASE statement
- Special built-in functions
- Currency conversion
- COALESCE
- WHERE Clause
- JOINs before or after the field list: INNER, LEFT OUTER, RIGHT OUTER joins (SELECT * is not allowed together with JOINs)
- Aggregations, fitering, grouping

  All non-aggregated columns must be specified in the GROUP BY clause.
  
- HAVING clause for grouping
- UNION/UNION ALL 

  You can define views which combine two or more queries. The column list of the queries must:
  - Have the same number of columns
  - Have compatible types based on the ordering


Alias are needed for the creation of new columns. 

### Open SQL

CDS Views can be used in the FROM-Clause of an OpenSQL statement.

CDS Views can be client-dependent, but they have no MANDT field as a Primary Key.
```
SELECT *
FROM ZCDS_EXAMPLE
WHERE flight_date > '20180101'
INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_table)
```

You can select data from a specific client by using the USING CLIENT Clause.
```
SELECT *
FROM ZCDS_EXAMPLE
USING CLIENT '100'
WHERE flight_date > '20180101'
INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_table)
```

### Annotations

CDS Annotation enrich the CDS data model with additional metadata. Different ABAP-Information can be inserted.

- The name of the generated ABAP dictionary view–MANDATORY
```
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName
```
- Buffering	
```
@AbapCatalog.buffering.status/type
```
- Client dependency –Default: Client dependent
```
@ClientDependent
```
- Reference information for amount and currency columns
```
@Semantics.amount.currencyCode
@Semantics.currencyCode
```
- The name of the generated ABAP dictionary append structure
```
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName
```
- OdataService generation
```
@OData.publish: true
```

### Associations

Enhanced support for the handling of relationships between entities.

Can be defined as part of the CDS-Views using the syntax `ASSOCIATION TO`, followed by the target entity and a `ON` Condition that states how the entities are related.

The syntax of an association is similar to the syntax of JOINs, so it is easy to transform existing JOIN statements into associations.

The addition of an alias for the target entity and specifying the cardinality are optional.

Path expressions can be used in order to navigate through associations.

The steps of a path in a FROM-Clause translate into INNER JOINs.



## Defining ABAP CDS Views

A CDS view is defined for existing database tables and views, or for other CDS views in ABAP Dictionary, using the ABAP CDS statement DEFINE VIEW. A CDS view serves to define the structure of an SQL view and represents a projection onto one or several Dictionary tables or Dictionary views.

The CDS entity `ZCDS_VIEW` defines a projection onto the database tables `scustom`. The generated SQL view `ZcdsView` comprises the ID, the name, and the city of all entries.

After activating a CDS view, the following objects are created in ABAP Dictionary:

- The actual CDS entity `Zcds_View`
- An SQL view `ZcdsView`.
