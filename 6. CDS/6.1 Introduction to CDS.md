# Introduction to CDS

To take advantage of SAP HANA for application development, SAP introduced a new data modeling infrastructure known as Core data services. With CDS, data models are defined and consumed on database server rather than on application server. CDS also offers capabilities beyond the traditional data modeling tools, including support for conceptual modeling and relationship definitions, built-in functions, and extensions. 

After the introduction of CDS in SAP HANA, SAP realised CDS can be introduced with ABAP application server which will allow ABAP to benefit from the enhanced capabilities that are offered by the data definition language of CDS compared to the form based ABAP Dictionary tool. So, SAP introduced ABAP CDS views in ABAP 7.40 SP05 release. Since the ABAP Dictionary already had the capabilty of defining tables, views and data types, the natural way of introducing CDS on the ABAP application server was to add it to the ABAP Dictionary. 

An ABAP Development Tools (ADT) based source code editor allows us to create Data Definition Language(DDL) sources in Eclipse or SAP HANA studio.
