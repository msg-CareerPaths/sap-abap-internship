# Object dependencies
During development, you sometimes need to change an (active) object already used by the system. Such changes are supported in the ABAP Dictionary by separating the active and inactive versions.

The active version of an ABAP Dictionary object is the version that the components of the runtime environment (for example ABAP processor, database interface) access. This version is not initially changed.

An inactive version is created when an active object is changed. The inactive version can be saved without checking. It has no effect on the runtime system.

At the end of the development process, the inactive version can be made the active version. This is done by activation. The inactive version of the object is first checked for consistency. If it is consistent, the inactive version replaces the active one. From now on, the runtime system uses the new active version.

If an object that is already active is modified, this can affect other objects that use it (directly or indirectly). These objects using another object are called dependent objects. On the one hand, it might be necessary to adjust the runtime objects of these dependent objects to the changes. On the other hand, a change might sometimes make a dependent object inconsistent.

For this reason, the dependent objects are determined and activated (if necessary) when an active object is activated. The active versions of the dependent objects are activated again. In particular, new and inactive versions of objects using the changed object are not changed.
