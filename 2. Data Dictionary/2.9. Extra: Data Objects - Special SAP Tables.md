# Special SAP Tables

In addition to transparent tables, where the definition in the ABAP Dictionary and in the database are identical, there are pooled and cluster tables in the R/3 system.

Pooled and cluster tables are characterized by the fact that several tables logically defined in the ABAP Dictionary are combined in a physical database table (table pool or cluster).

The idea of cluster tables is that you store functionally dependent data which is divided among different tables in one database table. Accordingly, the intersection of the key fields of the cluster tables is formed by the key of the table cluster (cluster key).

The data dependent on one cluster key are stored in the VARDATA field of the table cluster. If the VARDATA field does not have the capacity to take on all dependent data, the database interface creates an overflow record. The uniqueness within the table cluster is guaranteed by the PAGNO field.

The content of the VARDATA field is compressed by the database interface. Accordingly, the VARDATA field contains a description for decompressing its data. The TIMESTAMP and PAGELG fields contain administrative information.
