# Changing Tables

Correct access by ABAP programs to a database table is only possible if the runtime object of the table is consistent with the structure of the table in the database. Each time the table is changed in the ABAP Dictionary, you must check if the database structure of the table must be adjusted to the changed ABAP Dictionary definition of the table when it is activated (when the runtime object is rewritten).

The database structure does not have to be changed for certain changes to the ABAP Dictionary. For example, you do not have to change the database structure when the order of the fields in the ABAP Dictionary is changed (other than for key fields). In this case the changed structure is simply activated in the ABAP Dictionary and the database structure remains unchanged.
