# Data Objects in the ABAP Dictionary

## Data Types

Ideally, data elements use domains to define their technical properties. An ABAP program cannot, however, access domains for defining data objects.

### Domain
As a rule, data elements get their data types from domains. This data type can also be derived from an integrated type.
The domains are used to manage the technical properties of data objects centrally. Domains cannot be used directly in programs, tables, etc. The data type 'Data element' (see below) is used here as a bridge from the technical properties to the different data types / data objects.
### Data Element

As well as constituting the link between domains and the data objects, data elements also contain semantic/technical information about data objects created from these.
The field labels for the data field can and should be maintained in the data elements. These field labels (short, medium or long) can be displayed later on screens or selection screens to explain the field content.
### Structures

A structure consists of components in the form of data elements, integrated types, structure definitions of internal tables, DB table views or other existing structure definitions.
When the fields of an actual two-dimensional object are also taken into a structure by including a view or DB tables, the data object which can be generated from this remains flat (one-dimensional).
### Internal Tables

As soon as you insert an internal table as a structure component, this becomes a deep structure.
You can define internal tables or ITABs using an existing line structure. Database tables, structure definitions, views, data elements, direct type definitions or existing table types can be used as line types.
By declaring an internal table in an ABAP program, a two-dimensional Array is created in the main memory.
