## Introduction to the ABAP Dictionary

### Overview
The ABAP Dictionary permits central management of all the type definitions used in the R/3 System.
In the ABAP Dictionary, you can create user-defined types (data elements, structures, and table types) for use in ABAP programs or in interfaces of function modules, object methods, etc. Database objects such as tables, indexes and views can also be defined in the ABAP Dictionary and created with this definition in the database.
The ABAP Dictionary also provides a number of services that support program development. For example, setting and releasing locks, defining an input help (F4 help), and attaching a field help (F1 help) to a screen field are supported.

- Structures: Consist of components that can have any type.
