# Input Checks
The domain describes the value range of a field by specifying its data type and field length. If only a limited set of values is allowed, these can be defined as fixed values.
Specifying fixed values causes the value range of the domain to be restricted by these values. Fixed values are immediately used as check values in screen entries. There is also F4 help.
Fixed values can either be listed individually or defined as an interval.

## Value Table
The value range of a field can also be defined by specifying a value table in the domain.
In contrast to fixed values, however, simply specifying a value table does not cause the input to be checked. There is no F4 help either.
If you enter a value table, the system can make a proposal for the foreign key definition.
A value table only becomes a check table when a foreign key is defined. If you refer to a domain with a value table in a field, but no foreign key was defined at field level, there is no check.
