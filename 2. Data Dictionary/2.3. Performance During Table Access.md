# Performance during table access

An index can be used to speed up the selection of data records from a table.
An index can be considered to be a copy of a database table reduced to certain fields. The data is stored in sorted form in this copy. This sorting permits fast access to the records of the table (for example using a binary search). Not all of the fields of the table are contained in the index. The index also contains a pointer from the index entry to the corresponding table entry to permit all the field contents to be read.
When creating indexes, please note:
- An index can only be used up to the last specified field in the selection! The fields that are specified in the WHERE clause for a large number of selections should be in the first position.
- Only those fields whose values significantly restrict the amount of data are meaningful in an index.
- When you change a data record of a table, you must adjust the index sorting. Tables whose contents are frequently changed should not have too many indexes.
- Make sure that the indexes on a table are as disjunct as possible.
