# Views and Maintenance Dialogs

## Views

Data from several tables can be combined in a meaningful way using a view (join). You can also hide information that is of no interest to you (projection) or only display those data records that satisfy certain conditions (selection).

The data of a view can be displayed exactly like the data of a table in the extended table maintenance.

The structure of a view and selection of the data using this view will be shown with an example.

There are two tables: SCARR and SFLIGHT. The table SCARR contains two entries, the table SFLIGHT four entries.

The tables are first appended to one another. This results in a cross-product of both tables, in which each SCARR table record is combined with each SFLIGHT table record.

## Maintenance Views

You can maintain complex application objects in a simple way using a maintenance view. The data is automatically distributed on the underlying database tables.

All the tables used in a maintenance view must be linked with a foreign key. This means that the join conditions are always derived from the foreign key in the maintenance view. You cannot enter the join conditions directly as in a database view.
When creating a maintenance view, you should note the following:
- In Views, select maintenance view as the view type.
- All key fields of the primary table must be contained in the view definition.
- The client field must be included for client-dependent tables/views. However, the field is not yet shown in the maintenance view.
- For text tables as secondary tables, the language cannot be copied, as it is filled with the logon language automatically during maintenance.
- The key fields must be defined before the function fields.
- Function fields and key fields cannot be mixed.
